# Weasleys--Wizard-Wheezes
This is my first project created by following a tutorial on my typescript learning journey.


I'm currently learnig TypeScript. I've created this project following Web Dev Simplified's [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATafp15HWA&t=2373s) tutorial.
This project basically allows user to navigate between the pages, add desired amount of products into to the cart and updates the cart accordingly.

I'm planning to add different features to this project stay tuned!
